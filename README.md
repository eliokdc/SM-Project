Main questions we're searching an answer for:

    1- Does race have any effect on the choice of the partner ?
    2- How does occupation affect the decision of the partner?
    3- What are the activities that make a person more or less desirable?
    4- Are there certain character traits that make a person more or less desirable?
    
Note: The dataset and a PDF File that includes dataset source, our code and our analysis, are available in this repository.
